<h1>Hyper Text Markup Language</h1>
<p style=margin-top:40px;"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html의 정의">Hypertext Markup Language (html)</a> is <strong><u>the standard markup language</u></strong> for creating pages and web applications.
Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website development process, without which a web page does not exist. Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it. When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another web-page. A markup language indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations. It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3 recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and audio files.
